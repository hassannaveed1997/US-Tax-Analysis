# US-Tax-Analysis

The purpose of this project was to look at tax data to see where particular taxes were higher than others. Then draw on policy conclusions where the government might offer tax cuts. 

**Data used (2015 editions):**
1. [IRS Tax data](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/15incyallnoagi.csv)
2. [US Census Tiger](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html)

These data sets were combined and then GGPlot2 was used to make plots.
