# US-Tax-Analysis

The purpose of this project was to look at tax data to see where particular taxes were higher than others. Then draw on policy conclusions where the government might offer tax cuts. The current version is done for county data. There are similar ones based on zipcodes and congressional districts.

**Data used (2015 editions):**
1. [IRS Tax data](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/15incyallnoagi.csv)
2. [US Census Tiger](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html)

These data sets were combined and then GGPlot2 was used to make plots. Here is an example of the one depicting Average Mortgage Interest
